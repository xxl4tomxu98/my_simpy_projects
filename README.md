# This is respository of Simpy examples.
## SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. Processes in SimPy are defined by Python generator functions and may, for example, be used to model active components like customers, vehicles or agents. SimPy also provides various types of shared resources to model limited capacity congestion points (like servers, checkout counters and tunnels).
