# Introductory SimPy example: Two machines, which sometimes break down.
# Up time is exponentially distributed with mean 1.0, and repair time is
# exponentially distributed with mean 0.5. There are two repairpersons,
# so the two machines can be repaired simultaneously if they are down
# at the same time.

# Output is long-run proportion of up time. Should get value of about
# 0.66.
