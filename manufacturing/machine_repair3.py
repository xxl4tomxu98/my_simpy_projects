# SimPy example: Variation of Mach1.py, Mach2.py. Two machines, but
# sometimes break down. Up time is exponentially distributed with mean
# 1.0, and repair time is exponentially distributed with mean 0.5. In
# this example,there is only one repairperson, and she is not summoned
# until both machines are down. We find the proportion of up time. It
# should come out to about 0.45.
